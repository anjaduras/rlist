This is a small program in Python that helps keep track of books read. It can [store](https://github.com/psiwell/rlist/blob/main/books.csv) and show books from a personal reading list. The list can be updated by providing a new book title, author's name, year of publication and personal rating. The complete reading list can be exported into a [plain-text table](https://github.com/psiwell/rlist/blob/main/rlist.txt) or other format.
